"""
Author:   Karl Sims. 2017.
Aim:      Implement 3D version of Conway's Game of Life for LED cubes. 
          Make colors more interesting also.

Alternative rules for 'Life' in 3 dimensions used here are as follows:

    1) Any live cell with fewer than 3 live neighbors dies, 
       as if caused by underpopulation.
    2) Any live cell with more than 5 live neighbors dies, 
       as if by overcrowding.
    3) Any live cell with 3, 4, 5 live neighbors lives on 
       to the next generation.
    4) Any live cell with exactly 5 live neighbors develops a
        mutation causing it to change color. This is carried by 
        all its direct descendents.
    5) Any dead cell with exactly 5 live neighbors becomes 
       a live cell.
